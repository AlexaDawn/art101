        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p> I had a hard time keeping track of all the divs in my html. I accidentally typed too many and had to step through each line one by one and trace coordinating divs together. My blind eyes kept losing place and I had to count several times.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>My JavaScript output was not appearing, nor was the input prompt, so I knew I had either linked the Javascript in my html file wrong or the JavaScript function was not operating correctly. The console let me know it was the JavaScript file that contained a SyntaxError. </p>
